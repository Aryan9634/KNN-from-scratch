# KNN-from-scratch
Here I've implemented KNN algorithm without sklearn on iris dataset, I've structured the code in a way in which we can give any other dataset on which we can perform KNN algorithm accompanied by label and feature selection.
I've even done comparative analysis of KNN with and without sklearn for model score and observed that my code is giving more accurate results , I'm still trying to go deeper if anyone's having any advice for me.
More than welcome
